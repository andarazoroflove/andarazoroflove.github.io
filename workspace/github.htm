Why? Because they offer the kind of framework I built in to my site over the years with some improvments: repositories as projects, wiki-pages for writing, collaboration not just in text but also in code and I can wrap the whole thing behind my .org (in SSL!) with Github Pages.</p><p>All of my repositories are offered 'as-is' with absolutely no implied warranty or support. I'm a novice at programming (but I'm getting reasonably apt with ColdFusion) so one accepts that should one choose to use any of the code provided. </p><p>Some of the more interesting repositories on my Github page include: </p><p><a href="https://github.com/andarazoroflove/nettools" target="_blank">nettools</a> - an encrypted, single executable Windows cmd-let which allows for IP tools like tracert, ping, and telnet but disallows all other commands. Written as a training tool for Instructional Design at CVGS in 2004.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/andarazoroflove/razOS" target="_blank">razOS</a> - a PHP based &quot;Desktop Environment&quot; that runs in a browser. This is my customized version of the defunct EyeOS project which at the time was GPL. This is also circa 2004-2006ish but despite being very early on, this 3.x branch of EyeOS has interesting features including multiple users, the ability to customize settings, and is easy to read and build on. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/andarazoroflove/sparc" target="_blank">sparc</a> / <a href="https://github.com/andarazoroflove/Solaris" target="_blank">Solaris</a> - Before I was a Mac, I got my bigendian Unix fix on Solaris on SPARC processors. You have NO idea how much I regret not keeping at least one of my Sparcstations. I had a lot of em over the years, an SS20 (spOOn), an LX (fOrk), an Ultra 320 (f&amp;$king stupid huge, made the lights dim but had a cool 266MHz Pentium II processor based 64bit PCI-X minicomputer that ran Windows 2000 inside of Solaris), and an SS10 pizzabox. It makes me sad to see the prices on that stuff now on Ebay. The sparc repository is a collection of Sparcstation ROMs for various old 32 and 64 bit Hypersparcs that can be used with QEMU. The Solaris repository is a &quot;Coranto&quot; based (mostly PHP with static output files rather than a database) which contains 3-4 years worth of 'Things I've learned about Solaris.' Its tips, tricks, scripts, screenshots, and a few other things. It can't be browsed without running it on a webserver, but that's trivial and eventually I may dump the whole thing to a big running ODT. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/andarazoroflove/geocoin" target="_blank">geocoin</a> / <a href="https://github.com/andarazoroflove/faucet" target="_blank">faucet</a> - Remember cryptocoins? Yeah, me neither. I once upon a time wrote a gigantic 13,000 (neigh, 15,000!) word article with pictures on how to make your own version of a cryptocoin. Took me a whole summer to figure out and document along with matching repositories of before and after with diffs and commits. Its still out there, as is a concise version 2.0 and if you search deep enough you can probably find coinlab.vmware with the build deps and environment built in. While Doubloons was my first coin anyone cared about (and Unobtanium, <a href="../media/Un-smaller.mp4">which is shinier than Bitbar and colder than CGB</a> my most valuable and popular, 23Skidoo my hardest to mine, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/24/5933497/cthulhu-based-cryptocurrency-gains-ground" target="_blank">Offerings to Cthulhu</a> the most evil and written about, etc., etc., etc.) GeoCoin was the first. GEO began life as Smallchange but this version is 3.x. It has the &quot;Whispers to Cthulhu&quot; messaging, and is scrypt rather than Quark as most of my later coins were--word has it its easy to add masternodes in ala Chaincoin, but then again most of this code came from the master of clone-coins himself, &quot;Max.&quot; Bill Still, you're a shill. No seednodes are available, so do what thou wilt. The faucet is H4bIng3r's PHP/mysql JSON-RPC coin faucet and will work with nearly any coin that supports RPC. Again, no warranty, no help, no coins what-so-f&amp;$king-ever.</p></body></html>
