It has not been updated in a few years, but is still completely usable and can be found in .iso format on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vMCDZjspEFNQyw2K9qTnfroeTLsZjmzF?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>. </p><p>I am still using a Hyper-V virtual machine of the original CDEbian release which has been updated through Debian 9 and re-built with newer 2.4.x branch CDE code. CDEbian was originally built and tested on a Gateway Solo 2500 366MHz Pentium-II Celeron with 256mb of RAM. The 0.6-0.8 versions are based on VMWare Fusion and make use of the Refracta installer. All versions boot on nearly any legacy hardware or virtual PC software--as an example of compatibility, I recently booted it on VirtualPC 2004 on the iBook G4 I am editing this site with. As an experiment I did a fresh install of CDEbian on an Acer Centrino-based laptop and upgraded it through 9.x with zero issues. Upgrading to 10.x requires a rewrite of the script I call dtlogin with and my VM is primarily used via VNC so its moot. </p><p>While I'm on the subject, andarazoroflove is the only 'official' repository of CDEbian code and iso files. I am the original architect of the CDEbian project, graphics, logos, installer videos, and scripts. I extend a thanks to anyone who's kept the CDEbian mantle going. I have plans to (maybe) revive (possibly) this project over the next few months (or years) and finally (hopefully) deliver a 64bit 1.0 release with current Debian level underpinnings. I also plan to write a book and learn how to speak Spanish. CDEbian was a learning experience for me and the whole thing is well documented in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vMCDZjspEFNQyw2K9qTnfroeTLsZjmzF?usp=sharing" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p></body></html>
