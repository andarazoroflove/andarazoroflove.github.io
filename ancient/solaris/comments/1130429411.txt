I'm wondering what I'll need to do to get that to work after my compiles are done.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>   Thanks,&#13;<br>&#13;<br>      -Adam

You can do this manually by snagging the package from Blastwave.org or one of it's mirrors. Check this page:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http:// blastwave.org /packages.php /xfce_dtlogin&#13;<br>&#13;<br>(take the spaces out, damn fuzzymonkey :)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>In the pacakge you'll find all the files you'll need to add it to the DTLogin. Because the XFCE script from Blastwave is geared at the CSW install path of /opt/csw, you'll have to edit a couple of files to replace the pathing to YOUR install of XFCE (or you could always --prefix=/opt/csw your build). The files you'll need to edit are:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>/etc/dt/config/ Xsession2.CSWxfce &#13;<br>/etc/dt/config/ Xsession.CSWxfce &#13;<br>/etc/dt/config/ Xinitrc.CSWxfce &#13;<br>/etc/dt/config/C/ Xresources.d/ Xresources.CSWxfce &#13;<br>&#13;<br>I did it by extracting the package, pico'ing the files and copying them manually. Make sure you copy ALL of the files from the package to their respective places and issue a &quot;Restart Login Manager&quot; from the DTLogin page to see XFCE in the menu!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Hope that helps :)
