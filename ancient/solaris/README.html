	<b>1. Upload the .zip or .tar.gz file directly into your cgi-bin directory.</b>  Almost all folders will be 
	created automatically for you.  Do
	this on commandline:<br>

	<blockquote>
		<font color=green>$ unzip filename.zip &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font>*** or***<br>
		<font color=green>$ tar -zxvpf filename.tar.gz</font><br>
	</blockquote>

	
	<b>2. Check your permissions.</b>  Your directory structure will now look like this.  Listed out to the side are the 
	permissions for each file.  If you used the tar.gz file, your permissions will 
	automatically be set, because tar saves them.  If you used the zip file, you will
	need to set these permissions yourself.  A quick way to do this is with the following:<br>

	<blockquote>
		<font color=green>$ chmod 755 *.cgi *.pl protected/*.cgi</font>
	</blockquote>
	
	
	
	If you are on a Windows server, use your control panel to give the 755 files execute permissions.<br><br>

	<b>3. Make sure all these files are owned by the right user.</b>  If you are on a server that is not your own, you
	are most likely ok.  Ask your system administrator if you think you may need to change the ownership of these files.
	If you are on your own webserver, sometimes you will have to change the ownership to "apache" or "nobody" to get 
	the scripts to run.  Do this with:<br>
	
	<blockquote>								
		<font color=green>$ chown apache:apache * -R </font>
	</blockquote>

	
	
	<b>4. Move the "blogdata" folder outside the cgi-bin.</b>  Most webservers will not show pictures
	that are in the cgi-bin directory, so you will need to move the "blogdata" folder outside the cgi-bin to hold your pictures.  
	After you move 
	it, make sure to change the setting in the admin script to reflect the correct paths to the new location of 
	the folder (htmlpath). 
	<br><br>

	<b>5. Edit the settings to suit your needs.</b>
	There are also two very important things in the settings that affect how your icon displaying will work. 
	Make sure $htmlpath, and $htmlsystempath are correct for your server's directory structure.  
	They should point to a directory NOT inside your cgi-bin directory where images and files will be stored.  
	Change your settings at http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/blog/protected/manage.cgi.  
	Remember to password protect the "protected" folder so 
	others cannot tamper with your data and settings.<br><br>

	<b>6. Choose your language.</b>  My Blog is automatically set up to use English.  If you are using another
	language that is already supported by My Blog, just rename your appropriate language file to be 
	named "lang.pm," like this:


	
	<blockquote>
		<font color=green>$ cd lib/<br>
		$ cp francais.pm lang.pm<br>
		cp: overwrite 'lang.pm'? &nbsp;y<br>
		$ cd ../</font><br>
	</blockquote>
	
	If you do not see a file with the name of your language, it is not supported yet.  
	If you end up creating your own language file for a language that My Blog does not already have, please send 
	me a copy of your lang.pm named according to its language (francais.pm, not french.pm, please).  To create your own, 
	open "lib/lang.pm" and only change phrases that are between quotes.  If you change anything else, like the "our" or 
	the phrase following $ , which makes up the variable name, you could break the script.  Example:

	<blockquote>
		our $comments = "Comments"; # English<br>
		our $comments = "Commentaires"; # French<br>
	</blockquote>

	
	<b>7.  You may need to modify the first line of index.cgi, subscribe.cgi, comments.cgi, 
	post_from_email.pl, the plugin scripts, protected/post.cgi, and protected/manage.cgi 
	to point to where perl is located on your server.</b>  Basically, its just pound, exclamation point, then the path to 
	the perl executable.<br>

	
		<blockquote>#!/usr/bin/perl         (most common, and the default for this script)<br>
		#!/usr/local/bin/perl<br>
		</blockquote>


		<b>8.  Password protect the "protected" directory, so others cannot post to your blog.</b>  If you are on a 
	UNIX or Linux server, you can use htaccess to do this.  Contact your system administrator or google for 
	"htaccess" to find out how.  Also, no matter what kind of server you are on, you may have a tool in your
	control panel to password protect files and directories.  I cannot stress how important it is that you
	password protect the posting portion of this script.  Because this script is open source, meaning 
	anyone can see my code, anyone who has used this script will know how to access the post script.  
	Your only hope for security is to password protect it.<br><br>

	<b>9.  To use any of the plugins that come with My Blog,</b> copy the appropriate file from the plugins directory
	up one level to the blog directory.  The script checks for where they are, and if they are in the plugins 
	directory, it leaves them alone, but if they have been moved up a directory, it places the content of the script
	where ever the corresponding tag is in template.html.	For instance, if you want to use the photo plugin that works with 
	My Photo Gallery, copy the photo.pl file from inside the "plugins" folder to inside the "cgi-bin/blog" folder. Then create 
	a tag in your template that looks like this: <font color=green>&lt;!-- photo --&gt;</font>

		</blockquote>


	
	<b>6. Upload the files to the server.</b>  Make sure the directory structure is the same (all the folders are in the same 
	place as they werewhen you unzipped the file.)  You should put all the files in your cgi-bin directory.  Make sure
	you upload them in ASCII mode, NOT binary mode.  Uploading them in binary mode will turn all the files into useless
	garbly goop that cannot be executed.<br><br>

	
	<b>7.  Make sure all the executable files have execute permissions.</b>  Use your control panel to give all .cgi and .pl 
	files executable permissions.  If you do not know how to do this, contact your system administrator.  <br><br>

	See <a href="http://www.fuzzymonkey.org/newfuzzy/articles/FAQ.shtml">our FAQ</a> or read below.<br><br>

	If you get an internal server error, run it from command line so that you can see what 
	is going wrong and check your server logs for helpful error messages.  For instance, if its
	index.cgi that's giving you problems, do:

	
	
		<blockquote>
			<font color=green>$ ./index.cgi</font>
		</blockquote>
	
		
		
	If it's running correctly, it will return alot of html code.  If it does anything else, its obviously
	broken.  Look at the output and see if you can make sense of it.  Here are some sample errors and explanations
	on what they mean and how to fix it.

	
		<blockquote>
			<font color=green>$ ./index.cgi<br>
			Can't locate SOMETHING in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0 
			/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl 
			/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.0 /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl 
			.) at ./index.cgi line 29.
			BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./index.cgi line 29.</font>
		</blockquote>
	
		
		
		
	This can mean one of two things.  Its looking for a perl module to load.  It either means that you do not have that perl 
	module installed, or that it is installed into the wrong directory and perl can't find it.  If SOMETHING is common.pm, 
	sitevariables.pm, or lang.pm, then you are missing the lib/ directory or one of the files in it, and you 
	need to download and reinstall My Blog.  If it is CGI.pm or Digest/MD5.pm, you do not have a perl module
	that is required to run My Blog.  If you do not have one of these perl modules, you must install it.  Contact 
	your system administrator and request that they add that module to the server, or do a 
	<a href=http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=128077#permission>local install</a> of it.


	
	<blockquote>
		<font color=green>$ ./index.cgi<br>
		bash: ./index.cgi: Permission denied</font>
	</blockquote>

	
	
	
	Again, this error message means one of two things.  Either index.cgi does not have execute permissions, or it is not owned
	by the correct user.  See the installation instructions above to determine which of these is the case.

	
	
	<blockquote>
		<font color=green>$ ./index.cgi<br>
			bash: ./index.cgi: /usr/bin/perl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory</font>
	</blockquote>

	
	
	
	This means that your shebang line (the first line in any perl script) does not point to where perl actually resides on 
	your server.  See the installation instructions on the importance of this and how to fix it.<br><br>

	If you receive any other error messages, feel free to email them to me, and I will do my best to explain what they 
	mean and how to remedy the situation.  These are the three most common error messages you may get, and they are all 
	easily fixable.  There is also a <a href=http://fuzzymonkey.org/phpBB2>forum</a> and a <a href=http://www.fuzzymonkey.org/newfuzzy/articles/FAQ.shtml>FAQ</a>.
