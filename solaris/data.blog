1099062069###GProFTPd Package###http://solaris.andarazoroflove.org/packages/gproftpd-8.1.7-sol9-usr.gz&#13;<br>&#13;<br>You'll have to cut and paste the URLs for my packages, this blogger doesnt understand HTML yet...&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Here we have GProFTPd, a graphical frontend for the ever popular ProFTPd. This is version 8.1.7.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Built using GCC 3.4.1 on Solaris 9 SPARC. This is a 32bit Package and it installs in /usr. It was packaged using the make_package script from Sunfreeware.com.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>This was a program that required a bit of tweaking to compile. Solaris does not include the stdint.h header, and as far as I could find, there isnt one available. To that end, I had to modify the src/gprostats.c to include the correct Solaris header, sys/int_types.h. This allowed me to compile, and the program runs beautifully.&#13;<br>
1099062511###libIDL Package###http://solaris.andarazoroflove.org/packages/libIDL-0.6.8-sol9-local.gz<br><br>This is the libIDL Compiling Library, version 0.6.8. This was a required dependancy for Firefox, and I installed it because I'm trying to compile Firefox RC1 for myself. So far no luck, but if I get it, it'll be posted here :)<br><br>This was compiled using GCC 3.4.1 on Solaris 9 SPARC, and installs in /usr/local.<br><br>More info for this library can be found here:<br><br>http://andrewtv.org/libIDL <br><br>I am trying out a new attachment mod to the blogger, so you can download directly from the button below! I am also working on getting Directory Listing available for the packages directory.
1099062837###Welcome!###I've been meaning to do something like this for a LONG time, but I'm a procrastinator. This is my simple blog for my experiences with my flavor of Unix, Solaris!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I've been using Solaris regularly for a little over a year now. I say &quot;regularly&quot; because prior to diving in to a *nix, I got my POSIX fix with RedHat. While I still use Fedora, I have a serious penchant for SPARC based Hardware. My first SPARC was a fully loaded SPARCStation LX. It actually came with Solaris 2.5 loaded on it when I bought it from eBay, but I promptly replaced that with RedHat 6.2. That was 5 years ago.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>My current SPARC computers are a considerable bit more responsive than the old LX box. I currently have a SPARCStation 20 MP with 2x75MHz SuperSPARC IIs and a Ultra30 with the 296MHz UltraSPARCii. I am using a boxed copy of Solaris 8 on the SS20, and a Sun-downloaded copy of Solaris 9 on the Ultra. Sometime I'll post some pics of them, spOOn and fOrk 2.0, respectively. There's some pics of spOOn on the gallery, available from the main page.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Back to the switch. I had used Solaris at work, we run a couple IVR's and a scheduling program called IEX on SPARC based hardware and Solaris 7 and 8. I had always considered Solaris to be &quot;big-iron&quot; kind of stuff and was pretty intimidated. Once Sun began offering free downloads of Solaris, I thought what could I lose?&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I've installed it a few dozen times. I've gotten everything set up, just to have to start over again and again. I've gotten programs to compile that hadn't compiled before. I am still a newb. I've set this little site up so I can share my experiences, and others can add their comments.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>By NO means am I a Solaris expert. I consider myself fairly familiar with using *nix and simply want to share what works for me. 
1099147341###Package Directory Listing Now Possible!###I was able to get the Packages directory to be web-listable with a bit of php :)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Click on the word &quot;Packages&quot; in the Logo to go directly to them!
1099265525###Solaris 10 - November 15th!###I tried a couple of the beta milestone builds, nice stuff....It'll be really nice to not have to fsck for a week when the power takes me offline, stupid UPS :(<br><br>ZFS here we come!
1100323952###Azureus 2.2.0.0 Works!###I had no trouble what so ever running the older 2.1.9.4 build of Azureus on my Solaris x86 box, using the Linux Motif build. I'd never gotten it to work on my SPARC, even though I installed the latest JRE, even 64bit support.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I'm happy to say, as of the 2.2.0.0 release, there is actually a build of this most wonderful software for Solaris exclusively and it works on SPARC with the 1.4.2_05 OR 1.5 JRE's installed!!!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://azureus.sourceforge.net
1100356387###SoundTouch 1.2.1 Package###http://solaris.andarazoroflove.org/packages/SoundTouch-1.2.1-1.2.1-sol9-local.gz&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Here's a support package for the new &quot;Wired&quot; audio editor from http://bloodshed.net/wired. I'm working on getting the whole thing to compile, with all the support packages. I'll post them as I build them.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>As usual, this was built on Solaris 9 UltraSPARC using GCC 3.4.1 from Blastwave.org. It installs in /usr/local under the alias WULsoundtouch. &#13;<br>&#13;<br>WUL is my 3 letter package code, it stands for wOOble Unix Labs, though it really means nothing, its just another of my domains and the easiest way to identify my packages apart from others (CSW, SFW, etc).
1100360647###libsndfile package###This is another support package for wired, getting closer and closer.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://solaris.andarazoroflove.org/packages/libsndfile-1.0.10-sol9-local.gz&#13;<br>&#13;<br>More info on this library can be found at the Author's site:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/&#13;<br>&#13;<br>This package was compiled using GCC 3.4.1, on Solaris 9 UltraSPARC. It installs in /usr/local.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Remember, you can click the &quot;packages&quot; word in the logo to access the packages directory directly!
1100388867###I finally got Samba to work!###Ok, this is a beauty. I've never on any *nix been able to get Samba to work correctly from scratch. Sure in Mandrake and Caldera, they worked out of the box, but Fedora and Debian (the only L-*nixs i use) were always bust for me :(&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I'm happy my first WORKING Samba install (makes me sound like a total newb, tho I've been tinkering for years :( ) is on SOLARIS!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I had a bit of help, used the SunFreeWare.com packages of Samba, ncurses, etc. They install in /usr/local/samba but do NOT contain the /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf, you've got to make one. You can either check the samba.org docs and copy/paste one, or use SWAT to make one. I used SWAT via Webmin.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>There is an excellent tutorial on adding the inetd.conf goodies you need to have Samba start up automatically and building an smb.conf from scratch here:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://www.techgirl-net.com/samba.html&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Also, a good thing to note is that unlike Linux, Solaris doesn't use killall to restart processes. There is a command called pkill and restarting inetd is as easy as:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>pkill -HUP inetd&#13;<br>&#13;<br>:)
1100707459###24bit Color in Solaris###Ok, I've got 24bit Framebuffers. 2 of them. A Creator 3D in my Ultra and the rare 8mb 24bit SX in my SS20. How is it then that Solaris 9 cant recognize and initialize them in 24bit color out of the box? Well theres something to do with application compatibility and yadda yadda, but 8bit looks TERRIBLE!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>So heres the trick to make Solaris run in all its glorious 24 bits!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Make the directory /etc/dt/config&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Copy /usr/dt/config/Xservers to /etc/dt/config/Xservers&#13;<br>&#13;<br>edit the new copy and add the following to the end of the VERY last line (the one that starts with :0) -dev /dev/fb0 defclass TrueColor defdepth 24&#13;<br>&#13;<br>It'll look something like so:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>:0   Local local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 -nobanner -dev /dev/fb0 defclass TrueColor defdepth 24&#13;<br>&#13;<br>then reboot that puppy and enjoy your 24bit color! Needless to say, this isn't going to work unless you have a 24bit compatible framebuffer.
1101936903###x86 Solaris!###Well I had another power outtage, or rather my son pulled the plug on fOrk 2.0, and I had taken all my SPARC install media to work to play with spOOn. I had to re-download the media, and found there was a newer version. I'm currently using 4/04, and the latest was 9/04.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I fired up the Sun Download Manager and before I knew it was downloading...&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Burned the isos, 4x, nice and slow....&#13;<br>&#13;<br>DUH! they are x86 isos!!!!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>So I am now in the process of converting my Redhat Fedora Core 1 laptop over to x86 Solaris 9! It is a Gateway Solo 2500 333MHz with 128Mb of RAM and a 4.3Gb HDD. Linux runs decently on it, and so far so does Solaris. Got it all installed and its on the way to being functional :)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Will update and maybe a screenie or two later!
1102016660###Getting KDE on Solaris###This isn't really that hard to do, and works on SPARC or x86. You can certainly install from blastwave.org too, and use their pathing inplace of mine, but I've found that the older 3.1.1a release on the Solaris Software Companion CD is a tad more stable and an easier go of it, even if its a bit dated.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>To install KDE and get it to show up in the login screen's choices for sessions do the following:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Install KDE from the Software Companion CD or blastwave.org. The software companion will install to /opt/sfw/kde.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>In a terminal, as root: &#13;<br>&#13;<br>cd /opt/sfw/kde/dtlogin &#13;<br>&#13;<br>chmod +x (or 0777) install_dtlogin&#13;<br>&#13;<br>./install_dtlogin&#13;<br>&#13;<br>exit&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Now either restart the machine or refresh the dtlogin screen and KDE will now show up in the list of available sessions. Alas, this is not all that's needed to get it to actually run. &#13;<br>&#13;<br>I prefer to do the next bit in a Command Line login, but you could definately do it from any terminal, even remotely. &#13;<br>&#13;<br>Login as your user (not root) and add the following to your PATH statment in the .profile file for your user. This file will be in the user's home dir (/export/home/someuser) if its not there, just create it. I like to use pico which you can also install via the Software Companion or directly from blastwave or SunFreeware.com. If you don't have the bin directory from your Companion CD install in your PATH already, or there isn't a .profile file, then you can do this from any command line like so:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>/opt/sfw/bin/pico $HOME/.profile&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Add the line:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>PATH=$PATH:/opt/sfw/kde/bin:.&#13;<br>export PATH&#13;<br>&#13;<br>to the .profile file. If it already exists, you can just tack it on the end of the PATH that is already there. Just remember to add a . at the end of that statment and export it at the bottom of the .profile file.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>You can now log out and select KDE from the Sessions menu and pOOf, it will run!
1102181012###GFTP 2.0.18RC1 Package###Compiled this as an update to the 2.0.17 that is out on blastwave.org.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Nothing special, just standard ./configure and gmake :)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Built on Solaris 9 4/04 with GCC 3.4.4 UltraSPARC. This package installs in /usr/local.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://solaris.andarazoroflove.org/packages/gftp-2.0.18rc1-sol9-sun4u-local.gz
1103901499###Happy Holidays!###Well I'm off on xmas vacation, compiling random things for practice :)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Here's a package for the 0.7.6 version of cmdftp, a command line ftp that works like a shell.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Compiled on UltraSPARC Solaris 9 using GCC 3.4.4 and gmake.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Happy Holidays!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>
1106197317###glib 2.6 package###I'm installing the new XFCE 4.2 from xfce.org...&#13;<br>&#13;<br>It needed glib, so I built it :)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Built with GCC 3.4 on an UltraSPARC and Solaris 9 4/04.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Installs in /usr/local 
1107278425###Solaris 10 Released Today!###Solaris 10 is officially out. I'm attempting to download it, but Sun's servers are swamped!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I've been waiting for ZFS for a long time :) I'll be upgrading my Ultra30 to Solaris 10 as soon as I can get the .iso's.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>w000t!
1107439377###Got it! The Solaris 10 Install Begins...###Got all of the CDs last night, as Sun's servers got a bit more bandwidth back, it came in at a nice 45k. Got all 5 CDs, 4 Software and 1 Companion CD of GNU goodies...&#13;<br>&#13;<br>6:48am - Swap 4.1gb for 9.2gb 10K UltraSCSI, now fOrk has 2x9.1gb.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>6:55am - insert Solaris 10 CD1, Stop-A the boot and boot cdrom.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>6:59am - pretty blue CDE screen, select English (0) and continue&#13;<br>&#13;<br>7:02am - complete Identification, input IP Addy, Subnet, etc.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>7:03am - input DNS info and domain name.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>7:05am - have to leave for work, leave fOrk running, will resume after work or around lunch time!
1107439726###Install Continues....###7:08am - sneak back to hit F2 some more, system is being initialized....&#13;<br>&#13;<br>7:09am - Set out for work again...
1107440986###And Continues...###7:28am - a couple more F2's, now at the disk layout, doing a FULL install, 4.2 gigs!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>7:30am - REALLY going to work this time, will be home around 3 or 4, should be allowed to continue around 8....
1107492566###Back to installing.....###9:13pm - F2 again and the partition table is built. A quirk I don't care for is the default layout, and the /export/home automounter. I partitioned my install simply, / on one disk, swap and /home on the other. Both disks are 9.1gb 10K Seagate Cheetahs.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>9:16pm - CD1 starts installing...back to /.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>9:48pm - reboot, Trap 3e exception :( Had this before, bad superblock on the boot drive, most likely due to it being a UFS drive prior.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Crib'd this to fix it:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>TRAP 3E&#13;<br>&#13;<br>  Cause&#13;<br>  &#13;<br>   Ultra system fails to boot with TRAP 3E. The system sometimes also&#13;<br>   displays bad magic number errors.&#13;<br>   &#13;<br>   This is caused by a bad superblock on the boot disk. Which, in turn,&#13;<br>   could have beee caused by a SCSI configuration problem.&#13;<br>   &#13;<br>  Action&#13;<br>  &#13;<br>   To fix:&#13;<br>   &#13;<br>   1. Check SCSI bus for illegal configuration, bad cables, and duplicate&#13;<br>   SCSI addresses;&#13;<br>   &#13;<br>   2. Boot from cdrom in single user.&#13;<br>   &#13;<br>   OK boot cdrom -sw&#13;<br>&#13;<br>   3. Attempt to fsck(1M) boot disk. This will probably fail with a&#13;<br>   superblock error.&#13;<br>   &#13;<br>   # fsck /dev/rdsk/device&#13;<br>&#13;<br>   4. Find out locations of alternate superblocks. BE SURE TO USE AN&#13;<br>   UPPERCASE -N. For example:&#13;<br>   &#13;<br># newfs -N /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0&#13;<br>/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0:     2048960 sectors in 1348 cylinders of 19 tracks,&#13;<br>80 sectors 1000.5MB in 85 cyl groups (16 c/g, 11.88MB/g, 5696 i/g)&#13;<br>super-block backups (for fsck -F ufs -o b=#) at:&#13;<br>32, 24432, 48832, 73232, 97632, 122032, 146432, 170832, 195232, 219632,&#13;<br>244032, 268432, 292832, 317232, 341632, 366032, 390432, 414832, 439232,&#13;<br>463632, 488032, 512432, 536832, 561232, 585632, 610032, 634432, 658832,&#13;<br>683232, 707632, 732032, 756432, 778272, 802672, 827072, 851472, 875872,&#13;<br>900272, 924672, 949072, 973472, 997872, 1022272, 1290672, ...&#13;<br>&#13;<br>   5. Using an alternate superblock, fsck(1M) the disk. You may have to&#13;<br>   try more than one alternate superblock to get this to work. Pick a&#13;<br>   couple from the beginning, the middle, and the end.&#13;<br>   &#13;<br>   # fsck -o b=&lt;altblk&gt; /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0&#13;<br>&#13;<br>   6. The boot block is probably bad too. Restore it while we are booted&#13;<br>   from the cdrom.&#13;<br>   &#13;<br># /usr/sbin/installboot /usr/platform/architecture/lib/fs/ufs/bootblk /dev/rdsk&#13;<br>/c0t0d0s0&#13;<br>&#13;<br>   7. Reboot the O.S. Should come up now.&#13;<br>   &#13;<br>   # reboot
1107493192###Going on...###9:58pm - New splash screen, looks VERY nice, CDE loads, disk 2 inserted. Side note, unlike 9, the CDs are NOT separated in to &quot;install&quot; and &quot;software x of x&quot;. My media is mislabeled. Sad. Very sad indeed.
1107616572###That damn Trap 3e error strikes again!###All was well and good, had the Trap 3e error all outted, but alas, it returned!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I found a fix, to edit a bit of the nvramrc, and run a tiny script at the boot.

1107618521###NVEdit Tutorial###To get the nvramrc hack to work, I had to use nvedit directly, as the eeprom command formatted the contents kinda weird.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Here's a good tutorial on nvedit:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/nvedit.html
1107724926###inetd isn't really in Solaris 10....###an interesting discussion going on here:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://forum.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=22547&amp;tstart=45&#13;<br>&#13;<br>about the lack of inetd and its counterparts in Solaris 10, I have more to say, will comment later :D
1107795888###Restoring settings from an older box...###I copied my .profile and .vnc folders from the Solaris 9 system prior to building the new Solaris 10 system, and a few glaring issues became apparent after replacing them.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>First, you can NOT simply drop your old .profile on to the new one with out making sure it won't break the new stuff. My problem is on the old system KDE was my default, thus /opt/sfw/kde/bin was in my path first and foremost. On Solaris 10, I'm using the sexy new Java Desktop (Gnome) and it's goodies are all stored in /usr/bin. I placed the missing /usr/bin in my path BEFORE the KDE path, and now they both work.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Second, as to VNC, you need to reset the permissions on xstartup in the .vnc folder before it can execute its script and start your desktop. Otherwise you'll only get a blank checkerboard screen and the oh-so-familiar X cursor. You can reset them like so:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>chmod 0744 $home/.vnc/xstartup&#13;<br>&#13;<br>If you want to start KDE, you can place startkde in your xstartup file. I've found that the JDS 3.0 works just fine with VNC, instead of startkde, use gnome-session. My xstartup looks like so:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>#!/bin/sh&#13;<br>&#13;<br>[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] &amp;&amp; xrdb $HOME/.Xresources&#13;<br>xsetroot -solid grey&#13;<br>vncconfig -iconic &amp;&#13;<br>xterm -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title &quot;$VNCDESKTOP Desktop&quot; &amp;&#13;<br>gnome-session&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Now to figure out how to start this bugger automagically at boot....
1107920915###Great info on setting up init scripts...###http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/standalone_proftpd.html&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Has an example of setting up proftpd for use with an init scipt, precise and to the point. As a bonus, it works like magic too...lol.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I'm cutting and pasting it in UNMODIFIED form, so as to not lose it should that page dissappear. I'm also reading more up on init scripts, hopefully VNC will be my first one :)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>1. Edit your ProFTPD configuration file.&#13;<br>vi /usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf&#13;<br>&#13;<br>2. Change the following line in the configuration file:&#13;<br>From: ServerType inetd&#13;<br>To: ServerType standalone&#13;<br>&#13;<br>3. Make sure to prepend a &quot;#&quot; to comment out the &quot;ftp&quot; line in /etc/inetd.conf:&#13;<br>#ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/in.proftpd in.proftpd&#13;<br>&#13;<br>4. Send the inetd process a HUP signal via kill -HUP `ps -ef | grep [i]netd | awk '{print $2}'` or similar command.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>5. Create a ProFTPD startup/shutdown script in /etc/inetd.conf. Here is our /etc/init.d/proftpd script:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>#!/bin/sh&#13;<br>&#13;<br>case $1 in&#13;<br>'start' )&#13;<br>/usr/local/sbin/proftpd&#13;<br>;;&#13;<br>'stop' )&#13;<br>kill `ps -ef | grep proftpd | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'` &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1&#13;<br>;;&#13;<br>*)&#13;<br>echo &quot;usage: $0 {start|stop}&quot;&#13;<br>esac&#13;<br>&#13;<br>6. Create symbolic links to execute the ProFTPD script during system startup/shutdown. In our case, we will start ProFTPD in run level 3, and shut it down in run level 1.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>ln -s /etc/init.d/proftpd /etc/rc3.d/S99proftpd&#13;<br>ln -s /etc/init.d/proftpd /etc/rc1.d/K99proftpd&#13;<br>&#13;<br>7. Start ProFTPD in standalone mode.&#13;<br>/etc/init.d/proftpd start
1107922748###Unlike KDE...###Solaris Java Desktop System 3 (Gnome) can not be started simultaneously by the same user at the console and in a VNC session. I can (and could on Solaris 9 too) use KDE twice in 2 separate sessions, at the (K)Console and in VNC.
1108486956###Bochs 2.1.1 Package###A cool Pentium emulator, works on sparc, as Wine doesn't...LOL&#13;<br>&#13;<br>more info at:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://bochs.sf.net&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Built on Solaris 10, using GCC 3.4.2 UltraSPARC.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I'll post a screenie when I get home :)
1109779484###A bit more about proftpd and init scripts...###The stuff I posted the other day about writing an init script to start proftpd automagically worked great. Then I moved my Ultra down to my basement to make way for another development box with Linux as my 2nd desktop. Don't fret, this isn't my Linux fanfare, Solaris is still my fav, I'm just trying to broaden my horizons (that, and the fact I still for the life of me haven't figured out how to make the Ultra's Sound input work).&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Regardless, after it was moved it wouldn't start up anymore. Issuing a /etc/init.d/proftpd start errored out saying that it couldn't resolve the name of the computer. Basic Unix stuff here, if you don't use a DNS server, or I'd assume any other name server, you can add an entry to the /etc/hosts file for your computer. Fork is now using a static ip behind my firewall, so I added his name, and ip to the /etc/hosts file, and *poof* proftpd started using the normal command :)
1110754874###A Linux Tidbit...###OK so its not Solaris, but its *nix anyhoo...&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I ghosted my Laptop this weekend (Fedora Core 1 using the Sun Java Desktop system Gnome for those who wonder) and I used ghost 7.5...doh!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>It seems Ghost 8.0 and up support the GRUB boot loader and can restore it, otherwise, here's a tip on putting it back...&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/ghost.nsf/docid/2000042113083825?Open&amp;src=csm&amp;docid=1999021909463125&amp;nsf=ghost.nsf&amp;view=docid/1999021909463125?open&amp;src=csm&amp;docid=2000033111503625&amp;nsf=ghost.nsf&amp;view=docid&amp;dtype=&amp;prod=norton%20ghost&amp;ver=&amp;osv=&amp;osv_lvl=&#13;<br>&#13;<br>You DID make the Rescue disk when it asked didn't you? If not, the CD1 of the install works just fine, just boot it up and when it asks type:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>linux rescue&#13;<br>&#13;<br>:)
1110947986###WiFi forwarding on my craptop...###http://yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialIptablesNetworkGateway.html&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Has a killer tutorial on setting up forwarding with Linux. I can attest that it works using my crappy lappy and an Orinoco Silver PCMCIA WiFi card to provide WiFi access to my new Viewsonic V37 PocketPC with an SDIO WiFi card from San Disk. It's being configured manually, I'm not using the DHCP server on Fedora yet.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Now, none of this would really be needed if I had gotten that wireless router that I bought and paid for 3 weeks ago on ebay, though I haven't. I filed a PayPal claim, and the next day got tracking info stating that it had JUST been mailed out. Now it seems I don't really need it, bummer.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Oh well, It'll probably go right back on the market if I decide its worth the time....LOL!
1110948169###Fork comes back upstairs...###The Ultra has returned to my desk as my 2nd machine again. The Linux box I built went downstairs again, and I brought the laptop up for a 3rd machine at hand. The count now stands in my computer room:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>1 Windows PC&#13;<br>1 UltraSPARC &#13;<br>1 Laptop running Fedora Core 1 and the Sun JDS2 (oh yea thats right, Java Desktop System on RedHat)&#13;<br>1 PocketPC 2003 (Viewsonic V37, so much more svelt than my klunky iPAQ was...)
1112040372###Webmin on Solaris 10 is included!###Found this on one of the Sun blogs this morning, and had no idea.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jclingan&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Webmin is included with Solaris 10 in /usr/sfw by default. It has SMF and SMC integration and takes about 30 seconds to set up. Easier than building by hand, though webmin has always been a pretty easy product to get up and running.&#13;<br>&#13;<br># /usr/sfw/lib/webmin/setup.sh&#13;<br># svcadm enable webmin&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Too easy, and very sweet! Thanks Sun :)
1112372392###GIMPshop for Solaris/SPARC Coming Soon!###Yesterday on Slashdot, there was an announcement that Scott Mochella hacked up the GIMP sourcecode to make it feel more like Adobe's Photoshop. I use Photoshop 5 quite a bit, and had used the GIMP on linux a few times, but its interface left something to be desired. This is it. The GIMP is a VERY powerful (and free, thats good) package for working with graphics, and as such making it easier for Photoshop familiars is a good thing.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I am working on compiling a package in the standard pkgadd format, but for now you can look at my screenshot. This was compiled on my UltraSPARC 30 running Solaris 10 using GCC 3.4.2 and GNU Make 3.80. A package will be coming sometime today.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Check out the original site for lots of info and links to a bunch of diffrent distributions, including Gentoo, Debian, and ARCH Linux. I'm pretty sure I'm the first to compile it on SPARC :D&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://plasticbugs.com/index.php?p=241
1112383965###GIMPshop 2.2.4 Package Now Available!###Thanks to Scott from Plasticbugs.com for this killer app. Here's a Solaris package for it:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://solaris.andarazoroflove.org/packages/GIMPshop-2.2.4.sol10.sparc4u.gz&#13;<br>&#13;<br>It's available in the package directory now too. It installs to /usr/local/gimpshop.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Enjoy!
1115175039###Yawn!###I haven't posted anything in awhile, not for lack of using Solaris though. I've switched from using proftpd to using the more feature rich pureftpd (imo) and have tunneled it over SSL using TLS. I'm using my own selfsigned cert, as I don't have reverse DNS atm. Its working very well!&#13;<br>&#13;<br>I'll get back to posting more regularly (I hope) I am about to go back to school, online with the University of Pheonix, hoping to get a degree to bolster my meager schooling already. More about this to come on my personal site, at the root of this domain, soon :)
1117643491###Linux Packages?###Well, I've started to use Linux more and more, as my Solaris machine is where I want it. Its currently running my shell, secure SSL/TLS ftp site, and Bind server. Due to its paltry hardware and age, thats about all it's going to do. I still use it daily, but I've got some cheap PC hardware that Linux works great on, so this blog might start getting Linux tidbits more often.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>:)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>First up is some packages, rpm's for Samba 3.0.14a, built for Fedora Core 1, as Samba.org doesnt supply them. I'm still stuck in 2.4x kernel land, it just works better for me. You can get them at:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://solaris.andarazoroflove.org/packages/linux&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Enjoy, and watch for lots more!
1117683590###Opening ports on the Fedora Firewall###Found this excellent tutorial on opening ports on the built in firewall using iptables.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://stanton-finley.net/fedora_core_3_installation_notes.html#Azureus&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Suprisingly its for Azureus, just the program I wanted to open ports for. I dont know why there isn't a more in-depth GUI available for Fedora, though I know a lot of *nix users like it that way. I'm easy, if there is a GUI in the menu, lemme at it, but the command line is your friend.
1118290172###from the &quot;no i'm not really sure why you'd want to...&quot; dept:###You can stop the KDE kicker panel loading and start the gnome-panel instead. Not that you'd want to...but you can.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>This is how I did this on my Solaris 10 system, with the ancient 3.1 release (yes I KNOW!!!) from the Sun Companion CD, and stock Gnome.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>#mv /opt/sfw/kde/share/autostart/panel.desktop ..&#13;<br>#ln -s /usr/bin/gnome-panel /opt/sfw/kde/share/autostart panel.desktop&#13;<br>&#13;<br>If I were you, I'd back up the panel.desktop file, just stick it .. .&#13;<br>&#13;<br>:)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>This will let you run the Gnome panel (better than kicker even the newer versions, IMO) on the KDE window manager (faster for some reason on my Ultra30).&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Exciting!
1118373365###Solaris df command...###Solaris's df command (disk free, i think) doesn't work the same as Linux. In Linux, the df command by itself shows you the percentage of the used space, and how much is free in a quantifiable (2.7gb, etc) number. Solaris's df normally looks like so:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>$ df&#13;<br>/                  (/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s0 ): 5910408 blocks   866761 files&#13;<br>/devices           (/devices          ):       0 blocks        0 files&#13;<br>/system/contract   (ctfs              ):       0 blocks 2147483614 files&#13;<br>/proc              (proc              ):       0 blocks     3832 files&#13;<br>/etc/mnttab        (mnttab            ):       0 blocks        0 files&#13;<br>/etc/svc/volatile  (swap              ):  543904 blocks    35330 files&#13;<br>/system/object     (objfs             ):       0 blocks 2147483528 files&#13;<br>/dev/fd            (fd                ):       0 blocks        0 files&#13;<br>/tmp               (swap              ):  543904 blocks    35330 files&#13;<br>/var/run           (swap              ):  543904 blocks    35330 files&#13;<br>/home              (/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s0 ): 2132390 blocks  1014655 files&#13;<br>&#13;<br>That sucks. I don't want to know how many files, I want to know HOW MUCH SPACE is used! So try this version of df instead:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>&#13;<br>$ df -h&#13;<br>Filesystem             size   used  avail capacity  Mounted on&#13;<br>/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s0      8.3G   5.5G   2.7G    67%    /&#13;<br>/devices                 0K     0K     0K     0%    /devices&#13;<br>ctfs                     0K     0K     0K     0%    /system/contract&#13;<br>proc                     0K     0K     0K     0%    /proc&#13;<br>mnttab                   0K     0K     0K     0%    /etc/mnttab&#13;<br>swap                   275M   976K   274M     1%    /etc/svc/volatile&#13;<br>objfs                    0K     0K     0K     0%    /system/object&#13;<br>fd                       0K     0K     0K     0%    /dev/fd&#13;<br>swap                   275M   1.2M   274M     1%    /tmp&#13;<br>swap                   274M    24K   274M     1%    /var/run&#13;<br>/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s0      7.8G   6.8G   961M    88%    /home&#13;<br>&#13;<br>MUCH better!! There you can see the space, and where the stuff is all mounted. hoorah!
1118774123###OpenSolaris is HERE!###Oh yea! I'm going to attempt to build this monster on my Ultra30...wish me luck...LOL!
1120356042###Open Solaris Built and Installed!###Whew, I did it. I got OpenSolaris to build and install on my Ultra30 (took like 8 hours with 256mb of RAM) and a Dell Optiplex GX1 (no audio support atm for the ISA Crystal sound)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>:D
1124736756###Remote XSession from Solaris to Linux###This is a cool thing. You can get a remote XSession including the CDE logon as a virtual terminal on a Linux box. Execute this from the Linux box:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>X (display #) -query (host of solaris box) &#13;<br>&#13;<br>ie: adam@wooble $&gt;X :2 -query fOrk&#13;<br>&#13;<br>This will put the Solaris XSession on to the 2nd virtual console. You can switch back and forth between the Linux PC and the Solaris console using CTRL+ALT+F# (use F5 for the Linux PC, if you use :1 Solaris will be on F6, if you use :2 Solaris will be on F7 and so on)
1128206369###2 New Packages!###Here's a couple new packages I've compiled. Lame 3.96.1 and Darkice 0.15.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://solaris.andarazoroflove.org/packages/darkice-0.15-sol11-sun4u-local.gz&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://solaris.andarazoroflove.org/packages/lame-3.96.1-sol11-sun4u-local.gz&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Both were compiled on an Ultra 30, OpenSolaris 5.11 build 18. Compiled with GCC 3.4.2, installs in /usr/local.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>If anyone'd like my init script to launch shoutcast and darkice, leave a comment and I'll post it.
1128714251###Lame Compiling Error###Over the last week, I've re-built my SPARC computer from scratch with the latest (build 23) Solaris Express and the OpenSolaris BFU's. I ran in to some issues trying to compile Lame 3.9.6.1. I was getting an error like such:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Error: Illegal operands: There are only 32 single precision f registers&#13;<br>&#13;<br>This was using the Solaris 10 Companion CD's version of GCC (3.4.2). So I tried installing the Blastwave GCC 3.4.4, again no such luck.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>After much Googling and trying different things, it seems that Sun's default ld (/usr/ccs/bin/ld) is not terribly compatible with GCC in its native format. I installed Blastwave's binutils (/opt/csw/bin) and linked them one by one in to (/usr/ccs/bin). YES I know I could have changed my pathing, but I didn't. All of the g utils are now in my /usr/ccs/bin and it compiled perfectly! &#13;<br>&#13;<br>Unorthodox to be sure, but I'm more concerned about it working...as for why it worked on my old install, the pathing WAS correct for use from /opt/csw/bin, and I have since changed it on the new install.
1130250956###CDE with VNC on Solaris###Someone asked me how to start CDE in a VNC session remotely. This isn't hard to do though I wondered why you'd want to. Basically CDE is fast. Even on old SPARC Hardware, CDE is responsive and easy to use. Plus I'm sure there are some diehard CDE fans out there still. (not that they wouldn't already know how to do this)&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Edit the file $HOME/.vnc/xstartup and it will look something like this:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>$defaultXStartup&#13;<br>= (&quot;#!/bin/sh\n\n&quot;.&#13;<br>&quot;[ -r \$HOME/.Xresources ] &amp;&amp; xrdb \$HOME/.Xresources\n&quot;.&#13;<br>&quot;xsetroot -solid grey\n&quot;.&#13;<br>&quot;xterm -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title \&quot;\$VNCDESKTOP Desktop\&quot; &amp;\n&quot;.&#13;<br>twm &amp;&#13;<br>&#13;<br>As you can see, this sets up an xserver and starts twm as the window manager. To start CDE instead, simply replace the last line with:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>/usr/dt/bin/dtwm &amp;\n&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Consequently, you could also replace it with startgnome, gnome-session, or startkde. If you've installed XFCE, I believe the command is startxfce. This is certainly not a great tip, but useful none the less.
1130251368###Ultra 30 supports 15K RPM 36.4Gb Ultra320 SCSI###I'm posting this simply because I was not able to find any information about it while googling. The Sun Ultra 30 Service Manual (http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/802-7719-12) does not give a whole lot of information on what type of drives the Ultra line supports. I'd suppose this is because Sun would prefer you purchase drives directly from them, but my Ultra is so far out of warranty, I'd rather eBay.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Just as I was suprised to find that my old SPARCStation 20 would support 10K RPM 9.1Gb Seagate drives (whew they run HOT in that chassis though) I was just as suprised to find that my Ultra 30 easily supported a 15K RPM 36.4Gb Seagate SCSI SCA Ultra320 drive. I picked it up on eBay, surplus from an HP/Compaq server for $50.&#13;<br>&#13;<br>The Ultra 30 DOES support 15K RPM UltraSCSI drives. Plus it's tower design and 120mm fan in the front keeps them from overheating, but they do get warm to the touch. My Ultra lives in the basement where its always 60something and heat is not an issue...yet.
1130254863###QT Opensource Version Compiler Woes###So I'm trying to compile the QT Opensource version 4.0.1 and ran in to an odd error. I'd run the ./configure and get a message like:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>fOrk $&gt;./configure&#13;<br>&#13;<br>making qmake&#13;<br>gmake: CC: command not found&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Now I'm looking at that thinking CC? Did they mean cc? Of course. Doh! So I did this:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>root@fOrk #&gt;ln -s /opt/csw/gcc3/bin/gcc /usr/bin/CC&#13;<br>&#13;<br>QT will now compile. I guess I could have exported CC= in my path, but hey, why not make a symbolic link and never have to worry about it again?
1130255290###A BIG no-no for Solaris or is it?###One of the &quot;no-no&quot; things to do in Solaris is change the root user's shell. There are tons of discussions on why it is bad to do this and some on why it shouldn't matter. Here's a good FAQ about it:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://www.roble.com/docs/sol_root_shell.html&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Regardless, I did it. I changed root's shell to bash like so:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>fOrk $&gt;su - (this won't work if you are logged in as root)&#13;<br>Password: ********************* (yea my password is that long)&#13;<br>root@fOrk #&gt;usermod -s /bin/bash root&#13;<br>root@fOrk #&gt;exit&#13;<br>&#13;<br>That's it. I rebooted, crossing my fingers and poof my Ultra came right back up. Whew! If this was to break anything, I'd have simply &quot;boot cdrom -s&quot; from the Solaris install CDs and usermod'd it back to /bin/sh. Great tip, saved me from typing &quot;bash&quot; everytime after &quot;su&quot;.
1130383764###Solaris Audio Control###If you read this blog as infrequently as I post to it, you probably know that my Ultra is currently my shoutcast server. (mms://wooble.org:8080)The current set up is Shoutcast DNAS 1.95 SPARC, darkice .095, lame 3.97b, and an old Radio Shack PRO-110 100 channel scanner. &lt;/shamelessplug&gt;&#13;<br>&#13;<br>This is something that always perplexed me about Solaris, and I've finally figured it out, though its pretty trivial. The Solaris Audio Control tool is the program you need. Prior to discovering that (duh.) I was using kmix, which worked well but KDE is such a resource hog on 256mb of RAM. There is also another app available here: &#13;<br>&#13;<br>http://home.swipnet.se/~w-10694/utilities.html&#13;<br>&#13;<br>The command to run the Solaris Audio Control is:&#13;<br>&#13;<br>fOrk $&gt;/usr/dt/bin/stdaudiocontrol&#13;<br>&#13;<br>Wow. That's it. The command I never knew about because I don't use CDE enough and it's not on the menu in the Java Desktop System. (I think it should be, under Preferences) The Gnome audio tool that lives on the toolbar is only capable of mute, volume up, and volume down. If you double click it you are presented with 3 line levels which are locked in unison regardless. There is no choice for which input or output to use and the levels are named oddly. This command does exactly what the Gnome audio applet doesn't.
